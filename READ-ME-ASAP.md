PLEASE BEAR IN MIND.

This is a an old project in which I did not care about efficiency or code readibility. 

Why reveal the project then?

Every person in any field has his first projects and for me this is a memory I hold dear to remind me where I started.

On the other hand, I have this exact(expect CSS) project in another branch written in ReactJS and I tried my best there, check it out too! :)
